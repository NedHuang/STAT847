# Problem

Recall the physical laboratory involving the plane. (See the file background.pdf for more information.)

The equation of the plane can be written as
\[ y = \alpha + \beta x + \gamma z\]
which has no error.  All of the points lie exactly on the plane and both $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are unknown.  The planes were arranged so that $\beta = 0.5$ for every run.

Values of $x$ and $y$ were recorded by teams for three different experimental protocols or plans.  The third value $z$ was not.
In practice, the values of $z$ are never known -- there is always some variate that is not measured, perhaps not even thought of, that might be part of relating $y$ to $x$.  These are called **lurking variables** and they will always exist.

The purpose of this question is to investigate and compare the different experimental plans. Of particular interest is whether or not $x$ causes $y$, that is testing $H_0: \beta = 0$.  And if so, to estimate the value of $\beta$ defining the causal relationship.

# Plan

Three experimental plans were considered:

- `"observational"` where six $(x, y)$ pairs were observed in a particular configuration by each team.
- `"randomized"` where three tower-markers were randomly allocated to each of only two different $x$ values, from which the  $y$s were determined.  Each team produced two replicates here.
- `"randomizedBlock"` where tower markers were sorted into pairs by height and one marker of each pair were randomly assigned the lower of the two $x$ values and the other to the higher $x$ value.  Again, $y$ was determined after allocation for all six markers.


In this question, you will be working only with the data collected using the **randomized** plan.  See the file background.pdf for more information.

# Data

Set up the following:
\normalsize
```{r pathSetup no eval, eval = FALSE}
## Set this up for your own directory
imageDirectory <- "MyAssignmentDirectory/img"  # e.g. in current "./img"
dataDirectory <- "MyAssignmentDirectory/data"  # e.g. in current "./data"
path_concat <- function(path1, ..., sep="/") paste(path1, ..., sep = sep)
```

\newpage
\normalsize
The full data set is then read in as:

\normalsize
```{r load data}
labData <- read.csv(file = path_concat(dataDirectory, "labData.csv"))
```
\normalsize
The data can be subsetted according to the three different experimental plans.


a. *(1 mark)* Select that subset of the data corresponding to the randomized plan.  Assign it to the variable `randomized`.  Show your code.

# Analysis

b. *(4 marks)*  Plot the $(x, y)$ pairs from all of the randomized data 

    Use `xlim = c(0, 30), ylim = c(0,40), pch = 19, col = adjustcolor("black", 0.3)` in the call to `plot()`.  
         
    Label the plot meaningfully.  
    
    Fit a straight line model of $y$ on $x$ and add this fitted line to the plot.  Save the fit object.  Report the value of the slope estimate.
        
    Show your code.
    
    
c.  **Learning from repetition.** Each team executed the same plan.  Moreover, each team replicated that execution.  To gain a better appreciation of the qualities of that plan, we investigate the individual team estimates of $\beta$.

    i. *(2 marks)* Separate the data into two subsets, one for each `rep`.  Assign the two subsets to the variables `rand1` and `rand2` for replicates 1 and 2.  Show your code.
    
    ii. *(4 marks)* For each replication, fit a separate line for each team's data.  For each replication, capture the slope estimates of each team's fit and collect these into a single vector. Call the vector for replication 1's slope estimates `slopes1` and the same for replication 2's `betas2`. 
    
       Show your code.
       
        
    ii. *(4 marks)* Plot the $(betas1, betas2)$ pairs from the randomized data 

        Use `xlim = c(-1, 1), ylim = c(-1, 1), pch = 19, col = adjustcolor("black", 0.3)` in the call to `plot()`.  
         
        Label the plot meaningfully.
        
        Show your code.
    
    
    iii. *(4 marks)* Test the hypothesis that the team paired slope estimators,
         $(\bigwig{\beta}_1, \bigwig{\beta}_2)$, based on replicates 1 and 2, are independently distributed.  That is test $H_0: \bigwig{\beta}_1 \indep \bigwig{\beta}_2$.
    
         Use `numericalTest()` with the appropriate choices of discrepancy measure and generation function.
         
         Show your code.
         
         Write up your conclusion about the independence.
        
   
    
    iii. *(3 marks)*   Draw a meaningfully labelled histogram of the individual slope coefficient estimates for all teams for **replicate 1** only.
    
         Show your code.
       
         Use `xlim = c(-1, 1), col = "lightgrey"` in `hist()` and an appropriate `main` title and `xlab`.
         
         Add a vertical red dashed line at the average of the slope estimates.
         
         Add a vertical blue dashed line at the true value of $\beta$.
         
         Print the average and standard deviation of the slope estimates.
         
         
    iv. *(3 marks)* Draw a meaningfully labelled histogram of the individual slope coefficient estimates for all teams for **replicate 2** only.
    
         Show your code.
       
         Use `xlim = c(-1, 1), col = "lightgrey"` in `hist()` and an appropriate `main` title and `xlab`.
         
         Add a vertical red dashed line at the average of the slope estimates.
         
         Add a vertical blue dashed line at the true value of $\beta$.
         
         Print the average and standard deviation of the slope estimates.
         
         
    v. *(3 marks)* For all teams, draw a meaningfully labelled histogram of the average of the two individual slope coefficient estimates (over the two replicates).
    
         Show your code.
       
         Use `xlim = c(-1, 1), col = "lightgrey"` in `hist()` and an appropriate `main` title and `xlab`.
         
         Add a vertical red dashed line at the average of the slope estimates.
         
         Add a vertical blue dashed line at the true value of $\beta$.
         
         Print the average and standard deviation of the slope estimates.
         

# Conclusion

e. *(3 marks)* What do you conclude about the quality of team slope estimates from the randomized study?
    

f. *(2 marks)* What do you conclude about the value of having each  team average their replicates from the randomized study?
    
g. *(2 marks)* What effect, if any, has been produced by a lurking variable?  Explain.
